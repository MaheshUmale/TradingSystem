This outline details a comprehensive trading system that integrates the objective, risk-focused systematic framework defined by Robert Carver with the advanced, adaptive, and analytical capabilities of the Multi-Agent System (MAS) outlined in TradingGroup.
This hybrid approach leverages the LLMs for sophisticated analysis and forecasting (Steps 1-4) and strictly adheres to the mechanical discipline of Carver’s framework for risk and position management (Steps 5-6), thereby avoiding the human cognitive biases and LLM risk deviations.

Trading System Design Outline: Hybrid Systematic Agent
Phase 1: Foundational Intelligence and Learning (Carver + TradingGroup)
This phase focuses on deep asset-specific analysis and continuous learning, effectively addressing the need to backtest individual stock behaviour and parameters (Query Step 1).
Step
Component
Description and Source Integration
1.1 Instrument Selection & Data Acquisition
Carver's Framework
Select instruments (stocks/derivatives) based on criteria like appropriate trading costs, liquidity, and suitable minimum sizes. Ensure data availability for systematic analysis, requiring at least accurate daily price information.
1.2 Multi-modal Data Processing
TradingGroup MAS
Agents perform role-specific reasoning:
- News-Sentiment Agent
Filters real-time financial news, dedupes using vector similarity, and outputs an overall market sentiment score.
- Financial-Report Agent
Uses improved RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with hybrid retrieval to analyze company quarterly/annual reports for key indicators, operating conditions, and potential risks.
1.3 Systematic Parameter Learning (Backtesting)
TradingGroup Agents & Carver Principles
The Stock-Forecasting Agent calculates and analyzes quantitative features relevant to a "big move" (Query Step 1), such as:
- Technical Indicators
RSI-14 (overbought/oversold), Distance to SMA (Simple Moving Average), and Historical Volatility (HV-10). These parameters inform the volatility estimation critical to Carver's position sizing.
- Breakout Thresholds
The agent uses thresholds inspired by volatility channels (e.g., ATR Channel Breakout strategy) to identify valid breakthroughs or bottom breaks.
1.4 Storing Stock Learnings
TradingGroup Data Synthesis
An end-to-end Data-Synthesis Pipeline automatically captures and labels the outcome of every agent action against actual market results (Query Step 2). This generates "high-quality post-training data":
- Data Records
Logs agent inputs, outputs, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories, account state, and financial outcomes (rewards).
- Case Memory
Labels each decision as a "successful" or "failed" case, compiling an "experience summary". This memory forms the basis for the LLM agents' Self-Reflection Mechanism.
Phase 2: Opportunity Scanning and Forecasting (TradingGroup)
This phase uses the composite data streams to actively scan the market for high-probability "big move" opportunities (Query Step 3 & 4).
Step
Component
Description and Source Integration
2.1 Generating a Scaled Forecast
Stock-Forecasting Agent
Generates a robust trend assessment by integrating outputs from the news, fundamental, and technical analyses. This prediction is immediately translated into Carver’s required scaled forecast quantity (e.g., expected absolute value of 10, capped at $\pm 20$).
2.2 Determining Trading Style & Confidence
Style-Preference Agent
Analyzes recent performance and current portfolio status to select the most suitable trading style (e.g., aggressive, conservative). This agent uses self-reflection to dynamically adjust its style recommendation based on historical PnL results.
2.3 Final Decision Integration
Trading-Decision Agent
Integrates all upstream signals and the preferred style. It performs final self-reflection by reviewing past profit and loss cases before deciding on the final Buy/Hold/Sell action. This step effectively maintains the list of opportunities by evaluating potential trades against accumulated experience (Query Step 4).
2.4 Risk Profiling and Volatility Targeting
Carver's Framework
The decision to initiate a trade (Query Step 5) is preceded by calculating the necessary risk parameters:
- Annual Risk Target
Set the Percentage Volatility Target (risk appetite) based on conservative expectations of the achievable Sharpe Ratio (SR), ideally using Half-Kelly.
- Daily Risk Target
Calculate the Daily Cash Volatility Target by dividing the annual target by the square root of time (e.g., dividing by 16 for annual-to-daily conversion).
Phase 3: Execution and Position Sizing (Carver + TradingGroup)
Execution must occur only when the probability is high and must strictly adhere to mechanical risk controls (Query Step 5).
Step
Component
Description and Source Integration
3.1 Volatility Scalar Calculation
Carver's Framework
Calculate the Volatility Scalar—the critical factor that translates risk appetite into a position size. This is found by dividing the Daily Cash Volatility Target by the instrument’s Instrument Value Volatility (risk of owning one block in the account currency). The price volatility must be measured objectively (e.g., using a 25-day look-back EWMA).
3.2 Subsystem Position Sizing
Carver's Framework
Calculate the unrounded Subsystem Position (the number of blocks to trade) using the formula: $(\text{Volatility Scalar} \times \text{Forecast}) \div 10$. This ensures the position is consistently sized relative to forecast conviction and market volatility.
3.3 Portfolio Weighting
Carver's Framework
If running multiple instruments (subsystems), the position is adjusted by the Instrument Weight (often set via handcrafting based on diversification/correlation) and the Instrument Diversification Multiplier (accounting for portfolio risk reduction).
3.4 Execution Decision
Carver's Framework
The final position is rounded to the nearest integer block, creating the Rounded Target Position. A trade is issued only if the current position is outside the Position Inertia range (e.g., 10% away from the target) to minimize trading costs and overtrading.
Phase 4: Active Trade Management (TradingGroup + Carver)
Management involves dynamically adjusting risk and ensuring mechanical exits (Query Step 6).
Step
Component
Description and Source Integration
4.1 Dynamic Stop-Loss (SL) / Take-Profit (TP) Setting
TradingGroup Risk Module
The Risk-Management Module dynamically sets adaptive SL ($T_{SL}$) and TP ($T_{TP}$) thresholds using multipliers tied to the current Trading Style and the recent unannualized standard deviation of returns ($\sigma_{d,10}$). This provides immediate, style-tiered risk control.
4.2 Continuous PnL Monitoring and Hard Intercept
TradingGroup Risk Module
The system monitors the unrealized PnL percentage and immediately triggers a forced exit (hard intercept) if it breaches the set $T_{SL}$ or $T_{TP}$ thresholds.
4.3 Systematic Position Adjustment
Carver's Framework
Periodically, the system recalculates the Volatility Scalar and Subsystem Position (Step 3.1-3.2). This automatically triggers trades to adjust position size:
- Risk Maintenance
The trading capital is checked daily, and if price volatility changes significantly, the position is adjusted to keep the capital at risk constant, preventing sudden increases in exposure.
- Exit at Target
If volatility decreases (or capital grows) and the resulting target position requires a reduction (or increase), the system issues a trade to reach the new Rounded Target Position. This mechanism replaces emotional meddling with mechanical self-correction.
1.3 Systematic Parameter Learning (Backtesting) --> Can you write psudocode /python code for this step

This step, Systematic Parameter Learning (Backtesting), involves applying objective technical rules to historical data to quantify the instrument's intrinsic behaviour (volatility, momentum, and consolidation ranges). This aligns with Robert Carver's emphasis on using simple, objective, and transparent rules and avoiding complex, subjective interpretations. It simultaneously generates the foundational technical inputs required by the TradingGroup Stock-Forecasting Agent.
Since Carver intentionally avoided placing detailed algorithms in the main text, instead describing necessary concepts like Price Volatility (standard deviation) and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), the following pseudocode focuses on the key statistical calculations drawn from both sources.
Pseudocode for Systematic Parameter Learning (Step 1.3)
This procedure iterates through historical daily price data for a single instrument, calculating critical behavioural parameters based on specified look-back periods (e.g., L=20 days).
FUNCTION Calculate_Stock_Parameters(Historical_Prices, Lookback_L=20, RSI_L=14):
    
    // --- 1. Initialization and Input Data Preparation ---
    Input: Daily Data (Close, High, Low, Volume)
    Output: DataFrame containing calculated technical parameters
    
    // Calculate Daily Log Returns (Foundation for Volatility Standardisation [7, 12])
    Log_Returns = Calculate_Log_Returns(Prices.Close)
    
    // --- 2. Volatility and Range Metrics (Carver's Predictable Risk [13]) ---
    
    // Simplified ATR-20 (Approximation of fluctuation range, based on Log Returns std dev [14])
    Simplified_ATR_20 = Calculate_Standard_Deviation(Log_Returns, Lookback_L)
    
    // HV-10 (Historical Volatility of 10 days, unannualized [5])
    HV_10 = Calculate_Standard_Deviation(Log_Returns, 10)
    
    // Calculate Rolling Average (e.g., Simple Moving Average, SMA-20) [5]
    SMA_20 = Calculate_Rolling_Average(Prices.Close, Lookback_L)
    
    // --- 3. Momentum and Condition Metrics (TradingGroup Technical Indicators [5]) ---
    
    // RSI-14 (Relative Strength Index)
    RSI_14 = Calculate_RSI(Prices.Close, RSI_L)
    
    // 20-day High/Low Flag (Boolean indicator for establishing new extremes [5])
    High_20 = Rolling_Max(Prices.High, Lookback_L)
    Low_20 = Rolling_Min(Prices.Low, Lookback_L)
    High_Low_Flag_20 = (Prices.Close == High_20) OR (Prices.Close == Low_20)
    
    // Distance to SMA (%) [5]
    Distance_to_SMA = (Prices.Close - SMA_20) / SMA_20 * 100
    
    // --- 4. Defining Consolidation/Breakout Thresholds (Carver's Objective Rules [15]) ---
    
    // Breakout Threshold (Dynamically linked to volatility, min 1% [16])
    // This defines the necessary range expansion needed to identify a 'big move'.
    Breakout_Threshold_Percent = MAX(1.0, 0.5 * Simplified_ATR_20)
    
    // --- 5. Output Data Consolidation ---
    
    FOR each trading day t:
        Record Data[t]: {
            'Log_Return': Log_Returns[t],
            'Price_Volatility_20D': Simplified_ATR_20[t], // Core volatility measure
            'RSI_14': RSI_14[t],
            'Distance_to_SMA_20': Distance_to_SMA[t],
            'Breakout_Threshold': Breakout_Threshold_Percent[t],
            'High_Low_Flag': High_Low_Flag_20[t]
        }
    
    RETURN Data

Python Implementation Notes
If implemented in Python, external libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are essential for performing the mathematical operations efficiently, consistent with the practical need for robust data handling in systematic trading systems.
Parameter Calculation
Python Library Method (Conceptual)
Carver/TradingGroup Context
Log Returns
df['Close'].pct_change()
Foundation for objective risk measurement (Price Volatility)
Simplified ATR-20
log_returns.rolling(20).std() * sqrt(256)
Volatility standardisation for risk-adjusted returns.
RSI-14
talib.RSI(df['Close'], timeperiod=14)
Technical indicator used by Stock-Forecasting Agent.
EWMA Volatility
df['Returns'].ewm(span=36).std()
Alternative method for volatility estimation preferred by Carver (36 days is equivalent to 25-day simple moving average).
Breakout Threshold
np.maximum(1.0, 0.5 * df['ATR20'])
Defines the threshold needed to distinguish a consolidation from a valid breakout.
These calculated parameters serve three key systematic functions:
1. Objective Constraint Definition: They provide the precise quantitative features used by the TradingGroup Stock-Forecasting Agent to make predictions, notably informing the "Hybrid Gate" mechanism, which prevents the LLM from making overconfident predictions (e.g., forcing a 'sideways' classification if the Breakout Threshold is not met).
2. Forecasting Input: They are used in generating the raw forecasts (analogous to EWMAC rules) which are scaled to have an expected absolute value of 10, forming the basis for the combined forecast.
3. Risk Management Input: The volatility measures (e.g., Simplified ATR-20) are critical inputs for calculating the Instrument Value Volatility and the subsequent Volatility Scalar, ensuring that positions are correctly sized based on the asset’s inherent risk, independent of emotional decision-making.
can this method be used for intraday stock trading?

The methods outlined in Robert Carver’s Systematic Trading and the TradingGroup multi-agent system (MAS), while primarily focused on slower, systematic strategies, offer a combined framework that, with significant caution and specific modifications, could theoretically be adapted for intraday stock trading.
However, the sources universally emphasize the extreme difficulty and inherent danger of fast, high-frequency, or intraday strategies, especially for amateur traders.
1. Limitations of Fast Trading Highlighted by Carver’s Framework
Carver’s analysis consistently warns against fast trading due to overwhelming costs and the danger of over-betting:
• Costs (Overtrading): Intraday trading is defined as fast trading with a holding period from microseconds to one day. The central issue is that the costs of trading will "chew up a big chunk of profits".
    ◦ For amateur investors using typical instruments like spread bets, the sources state it is "impossible, even in theory, to trade these quickly and profitably". The estimated annual cost for a week-long holding period in a spread bet market (turnover 52) would require an $83%$ annual return just to break even.
    ◦ To overcome these costs and stay below the recommended speed limit (spending no more than one-third of expected profits on costs), a day trader would need to achieve a pre-cost Sharpe ratio (SR) of at least $0.40$ per instrument.
    ◦ To trade every day (turnover 256), a trader would need to reduce the standardised cost to around $0.00025$ SR units, which requires execution costs to be near zero, meaning they must "consistently achieving the mid-price or better". This level of performance is rare and difficult.
• Human Flaws: Fast trading exacerbates human cognitive biases. The factors of near miss and rapidity are "clearly more likely to be associated with very frequent 'day trading'".
• Barriers to Entry: Fast strategies require higher barriers to entry, including co-located servers, specialized execution algorithms, and fully automated software. Carver explicitly states that the domain of high-frequency trading "mostly falls outside the scope of this book".
2. Adaptation Potential Using the TradingGroup MAS (Theoretic Possibility)
The TradingGroup framework, while tested only on daily closing prices over 127 trading days, provides theoretical tools that are required for the complexity of fast trading:
• High-Frequency Data Requirements: Intraday trading necessitates fast, complex strategies. TradingGroup’s architecture is designed to handle multimodal signals (real-time news, reports) and process real-time market data.
• Automation: Fast trading is impossible without automation. TradingGroup is a fully automated MAS, utilizing five specialized agents for continuous analysis and execution.
• Hybrid Gating and Objective Rules: The core systematic constraint of Carver's model—replacing human emotion with objective rules—is mirrored in TradingGroup's Hybrid Gate, which prevents the LLM from executing "extreme misclassifications" by forcing a sideways classification if bullish technical patterns are not met. This objective rule mechanism could be adapted to enforce strict, high-speed constraints required for intraday risk.
• Dynamic Risk Management (Hard Intercept): The system uses a dynamic Risk-Management Module with "hard intercept" thresholds ($T_{TP}$ and $T_{SL}$) based on unannualized historical volatility ($\sigma_{d,10}$). This immediate, mechanical control mechanism is essential for fast trading, as it ensures prompt profit-taking or stop-loss execution when PnL exceeds dynamic thresholds.
3. Conclusion on Intraday Applicability
The combined methodology presents a high-risk, high-cost framework suitable only if extreme efficiency is achieved:
• Necessity of Automation and Tight Control: Any attempt at intraday stock trading must be fully automated and implement extremely tight controls and monitoring systems. The TradingGroup MAS structure and its dynamic risk module offer the technological foundation for this level of control.
• Carver’s Constraints Must Be Applied: To avoid system failure, the LLM-driven forecasting must be strictly subordinated to Carver's mechanical risk framework, especially regarding the Speed Limit and Position Sizing (Volatility Targeting). Trading rules must be rejected if they are too fast for the instrument’s standardised cost.
• Instruments: Intraday trading with derivatives popular among amateurs (like spread bets) is generally deemed unprofitable due to costs. The method would only be viable using the cheapest instruments, such as the most liquid futures contracts (e.g., NASDAQ futures), and only if extremely low standardised costs ($0.00025$ SR units) could be reliably achieved.
In summary, while the technology exists to automate fast trading decisions (as demonstrated by TradingGroup), the economic feasibility and inherent risks of intraday trading remain exceptionally challenging, aligning with Carver's warnings that only a "small percentage of day traders manage to cover their costs, and make both a reasonable income and decent return on capital".
consider data retrieved from YFinance and symbol is NSE:RELIANCE, write python code for phase 1

This Python code implements the Systematic Parameter Learning (Backtesting) component (Phase 1, Step 1.3), focusing on generating objective, quantifiable technical metrics essential for Carver’s systematic framework and inputting data into the TradingGroup's Stock-Forecasting Agent.
This implementation uses the yfinance library to retrieve historical stock data and standard Python libraries (pandas, numpy) for the calculations, adhering to the principle of using objective and simple rules.
